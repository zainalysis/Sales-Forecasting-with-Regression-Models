**Sales Forecasting with Python and Google Colab**
In this project, we solve a sales forecasting problem using Python, with a focus on key steps such as problem identification, data wrangling, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building. We utilize open-source libraries in Python in combination with Google Colab, so minimal setup is required.
